Quant Marketing Final Project. Course taken in Winter 2024

## Overview
The ready-to-eat cereal market is known for its high concentration, significant price-cost margins, extensive advertising relative to sales, and frequent new product launches (Nevo, 2001). In this project, I explored Nevoâ€™s cereal dataset and performed the following analyses:

### 1. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- **Objective**: To understand the distribution and characteristics of key variables such as market share, unit price, sugar content, and mushiness.
### 2. Simple and Nested Logit Models
- **Objective**: To estimate consumer choice models and understand the impact of prices on demand.
### 3. Random Coefficient Models without and with Demographics
- **Objective**: To capture heterogeneity in consumer preferences by estimating random coefficient models, both without and with demographic interactions.
### 4. Elasticity Estimation and Comparisons
- **Objective**: To estimate price elasticities and compare elasticities across different product pairs and market segments.
